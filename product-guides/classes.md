# ðŸ“Ž Classes

**Where to Join From:**

You should attend every live class to better understand the lessons and how to apply the knowledge. Attendance will also be recorded on the social platform of your choice where you watch the classes. However, you do not need to watch from multiple platforms at the same time. Please select the platform you're most comfortable with, like Twitch, LinkedIn, or YouTube, and ensure that you've enabled notifications for that platform.

**Attendance:**

Filling out the attendance form is mandatory. Once it's posted on your chosen platform, kindly complete it immediately. The attendance form will automatically close after the class ends. However, during the class, it may also be posted on both the WhatsApp 300DevDays group and the Discord 300DevDays group (please note that this is not guaranteed, it's a 50/50 chance). Be aware that the timing of attendance postings may vary; it could happen in the middle of the class or 10 minutes before it concludes. Avoid requesting the attendance form while the class is ongoing; it will be posted as scheduled.

Your attendance will determine your eligibility for the project phase after the program concludes. To qualify for the project phase, you are expected to meet a specific attendance percentage. Meeting this requirement will grant you access to participate in the creation of an exciting real-world product that will be used by people around the world.

**Note:**

Only those who actively participate in the project and successfully complete it will receive a certification.
