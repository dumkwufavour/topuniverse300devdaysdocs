# ðŸ“ž WhatsApp Platform

**300DevDays Group**:

Imagine this group like a special club just for kids who are part of the 300DevDays program. It's like a club where you meet up with friends and talk about fun stuff related to 300DevDays. You can chat, share stories, and help each other out. It's a bit like when you and your buddies gather to play games or talk about your favorite Nigerian foods, like jollof rice.

But, there's a rule - only kids who are part of 300DevDays can join. It's like having a secret party and only inviting your best friends. They do this to keep the club focused on the same cool things and to make sure everyone is part of the same group.

**Top Universe Ops Team Group**:

Think of this group as the control center for Top Universe, like the place where grown-ups make important plans. It's for the people who are in charge of running Top Universe. They talk about things like how to make everything work smoothly and solve any problems that come up, a bit like how adults talk about making sure there's enough power for everyone in Nigeria or making sure the roads are in good shape.

This group is only for the grown-ups who are in charge. They keep everything organized and make sure Top Universe runs well, just like how your parents make sure everything's okay at home.

**3dv-Activity Team Group**:

This group is like the fun and games team. They plan exciting activities and contests for kids in 300DevDays. It's a bit like when you and your friends decide to have a big game of football in your neighborhood or a drawing contest. The kids in this group think of cool games and events for everyone in 300DevDays.

But, here's the catch - only the kids who are allowed to make these fun plans can join this group. It's like when your friends pick a few people to decide what games you'll play at your big weekend get-together.

**3dv-Tutor Group**:

This group is super special because it's only for teachers. It's like a secret teacher's room at school. The teachers talk about what they'll teach, share interesting books and learning things, and make sure they're ready to help you learn new stuff. It's kind of like your mom or dad making sure you have all the right ingredients to make the yummiest Nigerian dish, like egusi soup.

So, these teachers help the kids learn new things and answer their questions, just like how your teachers help you understand your school lessons.

**Other Top Universe Groups**:

Sometimes, Top Universe makes other groups for different things, like book clubs or sports teams. Each of these groups has its own rules and things they do. Only the people who are supposed to be in these groups can join, like when your cousin has a club for playing chess, and only chess players can be part of it.

These groups have special jobs and rules, just like when you and your friends have different games to play, and you follow the rules for each game to make sure everything's fair and fun.

**Note:**

Any 300DevDays member who sends a message request to join unauthorized groups within the Top Universe WhatsApp community may face the consequence of being removed from the entire program. You are expected to focus only on the group you've been added to.
